## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(scales)

# Compute percentages within each city group

  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count))  # Calculate percentage

# Define color palette
colors <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Set2")  

ggplot(apartments_pct, aes(x = condition, y = percentage, fill = condition)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

            y = 0.1,  # Fixed height (10%) for all labels
